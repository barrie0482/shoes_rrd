 == cpu_usage.rb

cpu_usage.rb is a Shoes demo program using rrdwrapper and sys-cpu that records
historical cpu usage in a round robin database. It updates an image displayed
in a Shoes window each minute. It's rough, but it is a start.

rrdwrapper is a ruby wrapper around the rrdtool executable. There is a bug which
means a brief dos screen pops up each time a graph image is created. The problem
is that rrdtool graph returns the image size when it exits. I'm working on it.

Sys-CPU is an extension that provides various bits of information regarding 
your system's cpu(s)

Configuration:
--------------

The following three lines in cpu-usage.rb need to be modified to suit your
configuration.
Note: the rrdpath variable cannot use a path with a colon.
rrdtool uses the colon as a delimiter in some fields.
The rrdpath needs to be on the same drive where the program is running

ENV["RRD_DEFAULT_FONT"] = 'D:/projects/shoes_rrd/bin/DejaVuSansMono-Roman.ttf'
@f = Rrdwrapper.new('D:/projects/shoes_rrd/bin/rrdtool.exe')
rrdpath = /shoes_rrd'

screenshot.jpg in the archive shows an example of the expected output.

You will need to install Shoes to run this program. Shoes can be downloaded at

I have used files out of the following archives

 * rrdtool-1.2.30-win32-perl510.zip (http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/?M=D)
 * rrdtool-1.2.30.tar.gz (http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/?M=D)
 * sys-cpu-0.6.1.tar.gz (http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sys-cpu/)




At present, rrdwrapper has only been tested on win32. It should work with
minor changes on Linux and Mac. It has been tested with RRDTool v1.2.x.
I haven't tried it with RRDTool v1.3.x as I can't compile it on win32. :-)

TODO - not all rrdtool functions have been implemented
